# Pedestrial-and-Vehicle-Tracking-CS510
This is the implementation of pedestrial and vehicle tracking as part of the final project for CS510 Computer Vision

You would need :
1) OpenCV 2.4.11
2) Python 2.7

The best way to set up the installation would be to create these dependencies in separate environment.

You can choose any environment manager. I personally like Anaconda. 

Steps to install
1) Download anaconda. You can find it here - https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
2) Create a new environment and shift to that environment.
3) Install opencv 2.4.11 . You can do that with anaconda using, conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv.
4) Install python 2.7
5) install pygame use - pip install pygame.

Conda should install all depencies like numpy which this project uses.

Thats it!!

Should you have any errors while installing, make sure all packages are available and check if you have OpenCV installed. 
You can do that by typing python and in the console hit "import cv2" and check if you get errors.

you can run this program by typing:
./detect_follow.py  <i/p filename> --output <o/p filename>
